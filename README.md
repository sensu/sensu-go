## Protobuf

### Overview

We are using the version **proto3** of the protocol buffers language. Here's some useful ressources:

[To learn more about protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview)

[The proto3 language guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3)


### Installation

Install the protobuf compiler since we don't use the one that golang uses.
```
brew install protobuf
```
Otherwise, see the **for non-C++ users** [instructions here.](https://github.com/google/protobuf#protocol-compiler-installation)

### Quick Start

Once you make a change to any `*.proto` file within the **types** package, you will need to regenerate the associated `*.pb.go` file. To do so, simply run the [genproto.sh](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-go/blob/master/scripts/genproto.sh) script, which will install all required dependencies and launch the code generation (be sure to run the below `./build.sh deps` first though).

## Dependencies

Sensu uses [golang/dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) for managing it's
dependencies.

### Usage

Running the following will install `dep` (if it is not already) and pull all
required dependencies.

```shell
./build.sh deps
```

Later, if you would like to add a dependency, run:

```shell
dep ensure -add https://my-repo.com/my/dep
```

If you would like to update a dependency, run:

```shell
dep ensure -update https://my-repo.com/my/dep
```

When you would like to remove a dependency, remove the it from `Gopkg.toml` and
then run:

```shell
dep prune
```

## Testing

Install dependencies:

```shell
./build.sh deps
```

Run test suites:

```shell
./build.sh ci
```

Run end-to-end tests:

```shell
./build.sh e2e

# To run a specific test:

./build.sh e2e -run TestRBAC

# To prevent tests from running in parallel:

./build.sh e2e -parallel 1
```
