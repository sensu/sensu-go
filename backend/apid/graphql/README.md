## Covert from Protocol Buffer

In the case where you have a protocol buffer and want to create a GraphQL type
to expose the data to our users you can take a short cut. The script
`proto2graphql.go` found in the scripts folder will make a basic conversion of
the file.

```shell
go run scripts/proto2graphql/proto2graphql.go ./types/user.proto ./backend/apid/graphql/schema
```

It's important to note that the script is only meant to be run once for each
protocol buffer; if run multiple times it will overwrite any changes that were
made to the target file.

## Basic Usage

1.  Add new type / field definition(s).

    ```graphql
    # ./backend/apid/graphql/schema/dog.graphql

    """
    A Dog are the best pets.
    """
    type Dog implements Named {
      name: String!
      profilePicture(size: Size): String
      friends: [Pet]!
    }

    interface Named {
      name: String!
    }

    type Rabbit implements Named {
      name: String!
      friends: [Pet]!
      isFluffy: Boolean!
    }

    input Size {
      width: Int
      height: Int
      density: float
    }

    union Pet = Dog | Rabbit
    ```

2.  Next you'll want to generate the Go code for these new types. To do this we
    use the `gengraphql` script.

    From the project root, run:

    ```shell
    go generate ./backend/apid/graphql/schema
    ```

3.  Next we need to tell our service how the types themselves are implemented.
    To give an example, when a user selects a dog's friends, the service needs
    to know _how_ to retrieve those details so that it can be display them to
    the user.

    An example implementation:

    ```go
    // backend/apid/graphql/dog.go

    type dogFieldResolvers struct {
      // the autogenerated "aliases" use reflection under the hood to implement most
      // most the field resolvers; this allows us to write a bit less code with a
      // small runtime cost.
      *schema.DogAliases

      controller FriendsController
      logger     logrus.Entry
    }

    // Use controller to retrieve our dog's friends.
    func (fr *dogFieldResolvers) Friends(p graphql.ResolveParams) (interface{}, error) {
      dog := p.Source.(*types.Dog)
      ctx := p.Context
      friends, err := fr.controller.ListFriendos(ctx, dog)
      return friends, err
    }

    // IsTypeOf is used to determine if a given value is associated with the Dog type
    func (fr *dogFieldResolvers) IsTypeOf(s interface{}, p graphql.IsTypeOfParams) bool {
      _, ok := s.(*types.Dog)
      return ok
    }
    ```

4.  Finally we need to register the new type(s) and any of the implementation
    details with our service.

    ```go
    // backend/apid/graphql/service.go

    fund NewService(c Config) *Service {
      // ...
      dogImpl := dogFieldResolvers{controller: ..., logger: ...}
      // ...

      // ...
      schema.RegisterDog(svc, dogImpl) // include fieldresolvers.
      schema.RegisterSize(svc)         // unlike object type's inputs do not require any additonal implemtation details.
      // ...

      // configures registered types and implementations so that service is ready to
      // accept queries.
      service.Reconfigure()
      return service
    }
    ```

## Mutations

Mutations are how the client modifies the server-side data.

- [Reference](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations)
- Sensu follow's Relay's [mutation conventions](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/en/graphql-server-specification.html#mutations). Each mutation should consist of three
  elements. An input object type that describes the parameters to the mutation,
  an object type that describes the return values, and finally a field on the
  `Mutation` to be used as the entry point.

  ```graphql
  # mutations.graphql
  type Mutation {
    # ...
    addRole(inputs: AddRoleInput) AddRolePayload
    # ...
  }

  input AddRoleInput {
    # Used by a client to keep track of in-flight mutations
    clientMutationId: String!
    userId: ID!
    roleId: ID!
  }

  type AddRolePayload {
    clientMutationId: String!
    user: User!
    role: Role!
  }
  ```

## Deprecation

- Fields should not be removed until we can be confident that no clients are
  using the field.
- GraphQL supports @deprecated directive for marking a field as deprecated.

  ```graphql
  type MyType {
    one: String! @deprecated
    two: String! @deprecated(reason: "Two is bad number.")
    three: String!
  }
  ```

## File Conventions

- **Type Definitions** live in the `schema` package, and use the file extension
  `.graphql`.
  - When the type(s) they match an internal type defined in the
    `types` package the filenames should ideally match. (Eg. `entity.go`
    `entity.graphql`.)
  - Ideally all types and fields are
- **FieldResolvers** live in the `graphql` package.
  - Filenames should match the same name of the graphql file it is implementing.
