  Given a ref, field and a namespace returns a set of suggested values.

  As an example if you would like a list of check names you might use:
  `suggest(ref: "core/v2/check_config/metadata/name", namespace: "default")`

  Or, if you would like a list of subscriptions...
  `suggest(ref: "core/v2/entity/subscriptions", namespace: "default")`

  You may filter the results with the `q` argument, for example:
  `suggest(ref: "core/v2/check_config/metadata/name", namespace: "default", q: "disk")`

  By default the results are ordered by the frequency in which the result occurs in the set. The `order` argument allow you to tweak this behaviour, for example:
  `suggest(ref: "core/v2/check_config/metadata/name", namespace: "default", order: ALPHA_DESC)`

    Ref is used to uniquely identify a resource in the system as well as a field
    on said resource. Refs take the form: :group/:version/:type/:field. The

    refer to the name field nested inside a resource's metadata.
