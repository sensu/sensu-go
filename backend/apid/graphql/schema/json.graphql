# IMPORTANT:
#
#   The JSON type is defined /purely/ as a means of returning arbitrary
#   user-defined data. It should only ever be used as a last resort where a set
#   of data cannot be possibly be described by the GraphQL's type system.
#
#   Please, please, please do not use it unless it is absolutely unavoidable.

  can also be a map or list of arbitrary length.
