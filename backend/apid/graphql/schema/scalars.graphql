# IMPORTANT:
#
#   The JSON type is defined /purely/ as a means of returning arbitrary
#   user-defined data. It should only ever be used as a last resort where a set
#   of data cannot be possibly be described by the GraphQL's type system.
#
#   Please, please, please do not use it unless it is absolutely unavoidable.

"""
The JSON type describes any arbitrary JSON compatible data.

- Roughly equilevant to `union JSON = Int | Float | String | Boolean` however
  can also be a map or list of arbitrary length.
- Despite looking like an an object it's fields **cannot** be selected.

scalar JSON

"""
The Uint scalar type represents a unsigned 32 bit integer. Response formats that
support an unsigned 32‚Äêbit integer or a number type should use that type to
represent this scalar.

**NOTE:** As numbers are represented as double-precision floating point numbers
in Javascript the largest possible value is 2^53. As such 32 bit is used as the
lowest common denominator.

# A big number represents a number that is too large to be coerced by one of the
# existing numeric types. Response formats that support 64 bit [signed/unsigned]
# integers, floats and complex types should use the most approriate to represent

#
# To support the most languages possible, numbers are always coerced into a
# string.
