// The MessageBus is a simple implementation of Event Sourcing where you have

// all of the events produced. We've adopted AMQPs "topic" concept allowing
// the bus to route multiple types of messages.
//
// Consumers should be careful to send buffered channels to the MessageBus in
// the Subscribe() method, as Subscribe attempts a non-blocking send to the
// provided channel. If there is no receiver / or if the receiver is not ready
// for the message, _the message will be lost_. Events published to the bus are
// fanned out linearly to all (i.e. ordered) to all subscribers.
