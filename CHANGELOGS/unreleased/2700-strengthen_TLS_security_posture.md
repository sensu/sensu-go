- fixed all known TLS vulnerabilities affecting the backend server:
    - TLS min version increased to 1.2
    - Removed ALL but perfect-forward-secrecy ciphers
- removed requirement of specifying `--trusted-ca-file` when using TLS on backend
- prevented backend from loading server TLS configuration for http client
- enforced uniform TLS configuration for all three backend components (apid, agentd, dashboardd)
