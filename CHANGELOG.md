# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic
Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

## [5.8.0] - TBD

### Added
- Added per resource counts to tessen data collection.
- Added ability to query for `Handlers` (individual and collections) from the GraphQL query endpoint.

## [5.7.0] - 2019-05-09

### Added
- Added a Windows service wrapper for sensu-agent. See
"sensu-agent service --help" for more information.

### Fixed
- Fixed `sensuctl` color output on Windows.
- Fixed a regression in `sensuctl cluster` json/wrapped-json output.
- Fixed a regression that caused listing objects for a given namespace to also
  include results from namespaces sharing a similar prefix.

## [5.6.0] - 2019-04-30

### Added
- Added filtering support to `sensuctl`. This feature only works against a
  `sensu-backend` with a valid enterprise license.
- Added fields getter functions for resources available via the REST API.
- Added the message bus to Tessend in order to track Tessen configuration changes from the API.
- Added a performance optimizing `Count()` function to the generic store.
- Added a hexadecimal Cluster ID title to the `sensuctl cluster health` and
`sensuctl cluster member-list` commands in tabular format.
- Added a `Header` field to the `HealthResponse` type returned by `/health`.

### Fixed
- Fixed the agent `--annotations` and `--labels` flags.

## [5.5.1] - 2019-04-15

### Changed
- Added parsing annoatations to sensu-agent, both from agent.yml and command line arguments
- Updated Go version from 1.11.4 to 1.12.3 for CI builds.
- Changed the 1.x `client` field to `source` in the 1.x compatible agent socket. The `client` field is now deprecated.
- Deprecated the agent TCP/UDP sockets in favor of the agent rest api.
- [GraphQL] Added mutation to create / update using wrapped resources.
- [GraphQL] Added field returning wrapped resource given ID.
- apid uses a new generic router for listing resources.
- The store uses the generic List function for listing resources.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where etcd watchers were used incorrectly. This was causing
100% CPU usage in some components, as they would loop endlessly trying to get
results from watchers that broke, due to their stream terminating. Other
components would simply stop updating. Watchers now get reinstated when the
client regains connectivity.
- Fixed the `/events/:entity` route in the REST API.
- Fixed a bug where the --labels arg was not working as expected in sensu-agent.

## [5.5.0] - 2019-04-03

### Added
- Added the TessenD daemon.
- Added an etcd watcher for tessen configuration.
- Added ring support for TessenD so that the service is invoked in a
round-robin fashion within a cluster.
- Added `tessen opt-in` command to `sensuctl`.
- Added `tessen opt-out` command to `sensuctl`.
- Added `tessen info` command to `sensuctl`.
- Added more verbose logging to indicate when a proxy request matches an entity according to its entity attributes.

### Removed
- Removed the unused etcd watcher for hook configurations.

### Fixed
- [Web] Ensure user chip is never rendered when creator is not present.

## [5.4.0] - 2019-03-27

### Added
- Add support for pagination to the API
- Add two new flags for `backend` daemon to optionally allow for separate TLS
  cert/key for dashboard. the flags are: `--dashboard-cert-file` and
  `--dashboard-key-file`. The dashboard will use the same TLS config of the API
  unless these new flags are specified.
- Added notion of asset collections to dashboard daemon
- Added a store for Tessen opt-in/opt-out configuration.
- Added /tessen GET and PUT endpoints to the API.
- Added queueing to the agent /events API

### Changed
- [Web] Updated dependencies that had warnings
- [Web] Updated dependency babel to ^7.4
- [Web] Updated UI library to ^3.8

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in `sensuctl` where global/persistent flags, such as `--namespace`
  and `--config-dir`, would get ignored if they were passed after a sub-command
  local flag, such as `--format`.
- Fixed a bug in `sensuctl` where handlers and filters would only be deleted
  from the default namespace, unless a `--namespace` flag was specified.
- Fixed a bug where events could be stored without a timestamp.
- Fixed a bug where metrics could be persisted to etcd in some cases.
- Fixed a bug where agents would sometimes refuse to terminate on SIGTERM and
  SIGINT.

  even when multiple backends were specified. Agents will now try to connect to
  other backends, in pseudorandom fashion.
- [Web] Avoids crash when the creator of a check is inaccessible.
- [Api] Respond with 404 from the users endpoint when user for given name cannot
  be found.

  command (keepalives)

## [5.3.0] - 2019-03-11

### Added
- Added additional check config and entity information to event details page.
- Fixed all known TLS vulnerabilities affecting the backend server:
    - TLS min version increased to 1.2
    - Removed ALL but perfect-forward-secrecy ciphers
- Removed requirement of specifying `--trusted-ca-file` when using TLS on backend
- Prevented backend from loading server TLS configuration for http client
- Enforced uniform TLS configuration for all three backend components (apid, agentd, dashboardd)
- Set http client timeout to 15 seconds for sensuctl

- Fixed bug with how long commands were displayed on check details page.
- Assets downloads no longer specify a client timeout.
- Fixed a bug where agent entity subscriptions would be communicated to the
  backend incorrectly. Due to the scheduler using the subscriptions from the
  HTTP header, this does not have any effect on scheduling.
- Web - Fixes issue where timeout value was not displayed.
- Fixed bug with how long commands were displayed on check details page.

### Removed
- Removed the concept of "edition" and the edition header.

## [5.2.1] - 2019-02-11

run for subsequent executions.

## [5.2.0] - 2019-02-06

### Added
- Added support for the following TLS related options to `sensuctl`:
`--trusted-ca-file` and `--insecure-skip-tls-verify`. This allows sensuctl
users to use a self-signed certificate without adding it to the operating
system's CA store, either by explicitly trusting the signer, or by disabling
TLS hostname verification.
- Added a generic watcher in the store.
- Added `RemoveProvider` method to authenticator.
- Check output truncation support has been added. Check output can be truncated
by adjusting the max_output_size and discard_output properties.

`sensuctl edit`.

`Updated` instead of `OK`.
- Exported some functions and methods in the CLI client.
- The API authenticator now identifies providers by their name only.

### Fixed
- Check TTL failure events are now much more reliable, and will persist even
in the presence cluster member failures and cluster restarts.
- Fix snakeCase version of keys in typeMap for acronyms.
- Fixed a bug in keepalive processing that could result in a crash.
- Pin childprocess to v0.9.0 in CircleCI so fpm can be installed.

- Updates the copy on the confirm disable dialog to accurately reflect the
operation.

## [5.1.0] - 2018-12-18

### Added
- Support for the trusted-ca-file and insecure-skip-tls-verify flags in
  sensu-agent. These flags have the same meaning and use as their sensu-backend
  counterparts.

'when' properties defined should delete and recreate the filter. Filter when
uses the same facility as check subdue for handling time windows.
