# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic
Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added
- The `sensu.io/managed_by` label is now automatically applied to resources
created via `sensuctl create`.
- Added `created_by` to object metadata and populate that field via the HTTP API.
- Added agent discovery of libc type, VM system/role, and cloud provider.
- Added `float_type` field to system type to store which float type (softfloat,
  hardfloat) a system is using.
- Additional Tessen resource metrics can now be registered at runtime.
- Added a generic client POST function that can return the response.

### Changed
- Updated the store so that it may _create_ wrapped resources.
- Bonsai client now logs at debug level instead of info level.
- The dashboard service now returns an error if the client User-Agent is curl
or sensuctl. This should prevent users from using the dashboard port by
mistake.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where the agent could connect to a backend using a namespace that
doesn't exist.
- Subscriptions can no longer be empty strings (#2932)

## [5.18.1] - 2020-03-10

### Fixed
- Check history is now in FIFO order, not ordered by executed timestamp.
- Fixed bug where flapping would incorrectly end when `total_state_change` was
  below `high_flap_threshold` instead of below `low_flap_threshold`.
- sensu-backend no longers hang indefinitely if a file lock for the asset
manager cannot be obtained, and returns instead an error after 60 seconds.
- Stopped using the etcd embedded client, which seems to trigger nil pointer
panics when used against an etcd that is shutting down.
- 64-bit align the `Resource` struct in the store cache to fix a crash on
32-bit systems.
- Fixed a bug where sensu-backend would restart when agents disconnect.

## [5.18.0] - 2020-02-24

### Added
- Added the `/version` API in sensu-agent.
- Indicate in log messages which filter dropped an event.

### Fixed
- sensuctl now supports the http_proxy, https_proxy, and no_proxy environment
variables.
- returns 401 instead of 500 when issues occur refreshing the access token.
- Support Bonsai assets versions prefixed with the letter `v`.
- Fixed a bug where wrapped resources were not getting their namespaces set by
the default sensuctl configuration.
- read/writes `initializationKey` to/from `EtcdRoot`, while support legacy as fallback (read-only)
- check for a non-200 response when fetching assets
- `/silenced` now supports API filtering (commercial feature).
- Fixed event payload validation on the backend events API to validate the
payload with the URL parameters on the /events/:entity/:check endpoint and
reject events that do not match.
- The `auth/test` endpoint now returns the correct error messages.
- The `log-level` configuration option is now properly applied when running the
Sensu Agent Windows service.

### Changed
- Updated Go version from 1.13.5 to 1.13.7.
- Default `event.entity.entity_class` to `proxy` in the POST/PUT `/events` API.
- Proxy entities are now automatically created when events are published with an
entity that does not exist.

to intialize.

## [5.17.1] - 2020-01-31

### Fixed

by commercial secrets providers. Implemented for checks, mutators, and handlers.
- Added the `secrets` field to checks, mutators, and handlers.
- Added the `keepalive-handlers` configuration flag on the agent to specify the
entity's keepalive handlers.

failures had already occurred.

## [5.16.1] - 2019-12-18

### Fixed
- Initialize the sensu_go_events_processed counter with the `success` label so
it's always displayed.
- Fixed a performance regression that was introduced in 5.15.0, which would
cause the API to timeout past 20k agent sessions.

## [5.16.0] - 2019-12-11

### Added
- Display the JWT expiration Unix timestamp in `sensuctl config view`.
- Added the 'sensu-backend init' subcommand.
- Added a new flag, --etcd-client-urls, which should be used with sensu-backend
when it is not operating as an etcd member. The flag is also used by the new
sensu-backend init tool.
- Added the cluster's distribution to Tessen data.
- Added a new field, ClusterIDHex, to the ClusterHealth datatype.
- Added the `--etcd-discovery` and `--etcd-discovery-srv` flags to
`sensu-backend`. These are used to take advantage of the embedded etcd's
auto-discovery features.
- Added `--keepalive-critical-timeout` to define the time after which a
critical keepalive event should be created for an agent.
- Added `--keepalive-warning-timeout` which is an alias of `--keepalive-timeout`
for backwards compatibility.

### Fixed
- Add a timeout to etcd requests when retrieving the nodes health.
- Show the correct default value for the format flag in `sensuctl dump` help
usage.
- Installing sensuctl commands via Bonsai will now check for correct labels
before checking if the asset has 1 or more builds.
- Listing assets with no results returns an empty array.
- Fixed a panic that could occur when creating resources in a namespace that
does not exist.
- [Web] Links to documentation now point to the version of the product being run
instead of the latest; helpful when running an older version of Sensu.
- Fixed issue where keepalive events and events created through the agent's
socket interface could be missing a namespace.
- Fixed an issue where 'sensuctl cluster health' would hang indefinitely.
- Fixed several issues around the metadata of resources encoded using the
wrapped-json format, where the metadata would go missing when listing
resources or prevent resources from being created.

### Changed
- The backend will no longer automatically be seeded with a default admin
username and password. Users will need to run 'sensu-backend init' on every
new installation.
- Several deprecated flags were removed from sensu-backend.
- [Web] Changes to navigation. The app bar has been replaced by an omnipresent
drawer increasing the available space for content. Additionally, each page now
includes breadcrumbs.
- [Web] Switching namespaces is easier than ever, with the new and improved
switcher. The new component can be accessed from the drawer or with the shortcut
ctrl+k. For those with many namespaces the switcher now includes fuzzy search
and improved keyboard navigation.
- 'sensuctl cluster health' will now use a 3s timeout when gathering cluster
health information.
- 'sensuctl cluster health' now collects cluster health information concurrently.

## [5.15.0] - 2019-11-18

### Fixed
- Added better error logging for mutator execution.
- Fixed the order of flap detection weighting for checks.
- The pprof server now only binds to localhost.

### Added
- Added the `APIKey` resource and HTTP API support for POST, GET, and DELETE.
- Added sensuctl commands to manage the `APIKey` resource.
- Added support for api keys to be used in api authentication.
- Added support for sensu-backend service environment variables.
- Added support for timezones in check cron strings.
- Added support for extending sensuctl support with commands.

### Changed
- Moved `corev2.BonsaiAsset` to `bonsai.Asset` and moved
`corev2.OutdatedBonsaiAsset` to `bonsai.OutdatedAsset` along with subsequent
bonsai package refactors.
- Colons and periods are now allowed to be used in all resource names, with
the exception of users.

## [5.14.2] - 2019-11-04

### Changed
- Upgraded etcd to 3.3.17
- Listing namespaces is now done implicitly based on access to resources within
a namespace. Users will no longer be able to list all namespaces by default, in
new installations. Existing installations will function as before. Operators can
change to the new behaviour, by modifying the system:user role.

### Fixed
- As a result of upgrading etcd, TLS etcd clients that lose their connection will
successfully reconnect when using --no-embed-etcd.
- Check TTL switches are now correctly buried when associated events and entities
are deleted.
- Keepalive switches are now correctly buried when the keepalive event is deleted.
- Sensu now uses far fewer leases for keepalives and check TTLs, resulting in a
stability improvement for most deployments.
- Fixed a minor UX issue in interactive filter commands in sensuctl.
- Silences now successfully apply to proxy entities where the check doesn't contain
  the same subscriptions as the entity (#3356)

## [5.14.1] - 2019-10-16

### Added
- Added prometheus gauges for check schedulers.

### Fixed
- Opening an already open Bolt database should not cause sensu-agent to hang
indefinitely.
- [CLI] Dump multiple types as YAML to a file would print separator STDOUT
instead of specified file
- Fixed a bug where Sensu would crash with a panic due to a send on a closed channel.

## [5.14.0] - 2019-10-08

### Added
- [Web] Added an additional option to the error dialog allowing users to
completely wipe the application's persisted state; in lieu of them having to
manually wipe their local / session storage. This may help in the rare cases
where something in said state is leading to an uncaught exception.
- [Web] For operating systems with support for selecting a preferred light /dark
theme, the application now respects the system preference by default.
- sensuctl dump can now list the types of supported resources with --types.
- Added the `sensu_agent_version` field to the `Entity` resource, which reflects
the Sensu semver version of the agent entity.
- Added the `--etcd-heartbeat-interval` and `--etcd-election-timeout` flags to
`sensu-backend`

### Changed
- [Web] Github is not always the best place for feature requests and discussion,
as such we've changed CTA for feedback to point to Discourse instead of the
web repository's issues page.
- [Web] When a user lands on a page inside a namespace that no longer exists or
they do not have access to, the drawer is now opened so that namespace switcher
is front and center. Hopefully this should reduce any confusion around next
steps.
- Support agent TLS authentication, usable with a licensed sensu-backend.
- Updated Go version from 1.12.3 to 1.13.1.
- [GraphQL] `putWrapped` mutation now accepts wrapped JSON with empty
outer objectmeta.

### Fixed
- [Web] Fixed issue where a user with an appropriate role may have been unable
to resolve events, queue checks, and create silenced entries.
- Splayed proxy checks are now executed every interval, instead of every
`interval + interval * splay_coverage`.
- [GraphQL] Ensures that proxy entity label & annotations are redacted.
- Fixed a bug in the ring where round robin schedules would not recover
after quorum loss.
- [Web] Unauthorized errors emitted while creating silences or resolving events
are now caught and a toast is presented to communicate what occurred.
- [Web] Internal errors are now avoided when a user attempts to queue an ad-hoc
check for a keepalive.
- Do not separate asset builds into several assets unless the the tabular format
is used in `sensuctl asset list`.
- Fix the 'flag accessed but not defined' error in `sensuctl asset outdated`
- Fix generic API client's `SetTypeMeta` method. The APIGroup is now correctly
configured and by virtue unintended authorization denied errs are avoided.
- Fixed a bug where checks would stop executing after a network error.
- Fixed a bug where sensuctl create with stdin was not working.

redacted secrets).

## [5.11.1] - 2019-07-18

### Fixed
- The agent now sends heartbeats to the backend in order to detect network
failures and reconnect faster.

were not getting properly populated.
- Fixed a bug where multiple nested set handlers could be incorrectly flagged as
deeply nested.
- Fixed a bug where round robin proxy checks could fail to execute.

usage until sensu-backend was restarted.

## [5.10.1] - 2019-06-25

### Fixed
- Fixed the entity_attributes in proxy_requests so all attributes must match
instead of only one of them.
- Fixed a bug where events were not deleted when their corresponding entity was.

## [5.10.0] - 2019-06-18

- Eventd has been refactored. Users should not perceive any changes, but a
substantial amount of business logic has been moved into other packages.
- The `sensuctl create` command now accepts resources without a declared
namespace. If the namespace is omitted, the resource will be created in the
current namespace, or overridden by the `--namespace` flag.

100% CPU usage in some components, as they would loop endlessly trying to get
results from watchers that broke, due to their stream terminating. Other
components would simply stop updating. Watchers now get reinstated when the
client regains connectivity.
- Fixed the `/events/:entity` route in the REST API.

- [Web] Updated UI library to ^3.8

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in `sensuctl` where global/persistent flags, such as `--namespace`
  and `--config-dir`, would get ignored if they were passed after a sub-command
  local flag, such as `--format`.
- Fixed a bug in `sensuctl` where handlers and filters would only be deleted
  from the default namespace, unless a `--namespace` flag was specified.

## [5.3.0] - 2019-03-11

### Added
- Added additional check config and entity information to event details page.
- Fixed all known TLS vulnerabilities affecting the backend server:
    - TLS min version increased to 1.2
    - Removed ALL but perfect-forward-secrecy ciphers
- Removed requirement of specifying `--trusted-ca-file` when using TLS on backend
- Prevented backend from loading server TLS configuration for http client
- Enforced uniform TLS configuration for all three backend components (apid, agentd, dashboardd)

- Round robin scheduling is now fully functional.
- Web UI offline state detection and and alert banner.

### Changed
- Asset downloading now uses buffered I/O.

- Fixed bug with how long commands were displayed on check details page.
- Assets downloads no longer specify a client timeout.
- Fixed a bug where agent entity subscriptions would be communicated to the
  backend incorrectly. Due to the scheduler using the subscriptions from the
  HTTP header, this does not have any effect on scheduling.
- Web - Fixes issue where timeout value was not displayed.
- Fixed bug with how long commands were displayed on check details page.

### Removed
- Removed the concept of "edition" and the edition header.

## [5.2.1] - 2019-02-11

## [5.2.0] - 2019-02-06

### Added
- Added support for the following TLS related options to `sensuctl`:
`--trusted-ca-file` and `--insecure-skip-tls-verify`. This allows sensuctl
users to use a self-signed certificate without adding it to the operating
system's CA store, either by explicitly trusting the signer, or by disabling
TLS hostname verification.
- Added a generic watcher in the store.
- Added `RemoveProvider` method to authenticator.
- Check output truncation support has been added. Check output can be truncated
by adjusting the max_output_size and discard_output properties.

- Moved the `Provider` interface to `api/core/v2` package.
- Moved the `Authenticator` interface to `backend/authentication` package.
- Updated confirmation messages for sensuctl commands: `Created`, `Deleted` and
`Updated` instead of `OK`.
- Exported some functions and methods in the CLI client.
- The API authenticator now identifies providers by their name only.

### Fixed
- Check TTL failure events are now much more reliable, and will persist even
in the presence cluster member failures and cluster restarts.
