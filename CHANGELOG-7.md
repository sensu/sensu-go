## [Unreleased]

### Breaking
- Embedded etcd is no longer supported, all related configuration has been
removed.

software is upgraded when there are active keepalive failures.
- Etcd client configuration options have changed.

### Added
- Developer mode can now be enabled with the --dev flag.
- Added sensu-backend configuration for postgresql.
- Added configuration store selector to sensu-backend.
- Added postgresql state store.

### Changed
- Changed parameters for `sensuctl cluster-role create` to be plural
- Deregistration events are now silenced if a silenced entry exists matching the
entity subscriptions and/or a check named `deregistration`.
- Upgraded Go version from 1.17.1 to 1.18.1.
- Changed sensu-backend etcd configuration options.
- Added VMware as a value return in `GetCloudProvider` function.

### Removed
- Removed sensu-backend upgrade command. May make an appearance again in later versions.
