# Contributing

We, the maintainers, love pull requests from everyone, but often find
we must say "no" despite how reasonable the proposal may seem.

For this reason, we ask that you open an issue to discuss proposed
changes prior to submitting a pull request for the implementation.
This helps us to provide direction as to implementation details, which
branch to base your changes on, and so on.

1. Open an issue to describe your proposed improvement or feature
1. Fork https://github.com/sensu/sensu-go
1. Clone the fork to $GOPATH/src/github.com/sensu/sensu-go. (This exact path must be used. If GOPATH is undefined, use /home/go.)
1. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
1. If applicable, add a [CHANGELOG.md entry](#changelog) describing your change.
1. Commit your changes with a [DCO Signed-off-by statement](#dco) (`git commit --signoff`)
1. Push your feature branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
1. Create a Pull Request as appropriate based on the issue discussion

Sensu is and always will be open source, and we continue to highly
value community contribution. The packages we’re releasing for new
versions are from our Enterprise repo; Sensu Go is the upstream for
Sensu Enterprise (as they’d say in the Go community: Sensu Go is
vendored into the Sensu Enterprise Go repo). We encourage you to
download new versions, as the functionality will be identical to what
you find in the public repo, and access to the enterprise-only
features can be unlocked with a license key. Because these releases
are in our Enterprise repo, there may be times that you don’t see the
actual work being done on an issue you open, but that doesn’t mean
we’re not working on it! Our team is committed to updating progress on
open issues in the sensu-go repo, even if that work is being done in
our Enterprise repo.

## DCO

To make a good faith effort to ensure the criteria of the MIT License
are met, Sensu Inc. requires the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
process to be followed.

The DCO is an attestation attached to every contribution made by every
developer. In the commit message of the contribution, the developer
simply adds a Signed-off-by statement and thereby agrees to the DCO,
which you can find below or at http://developercertificate.org/.

```
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

The following is an example DCO Signed-off-by statement.

```
 Author: Sean Porter <sean@sensu.io>

 Committer: Greg Poirier <greg@sensu.io>

   Let's name it WizardFormat.

   Calling it the Sensu Metric Format was a mistake.

   Signed-off-by: Sean Porter <sean@sensu.io>
   Signed-off-by: Grep Poirier <greg@sensu.io>
```

Git makes this easy with `git commit --signoff`!

The DCO text can either be manually added to your commit body, or you
can add either `-s` or `--signoff` to your usual git commit commands.
If you forget to add the sign-off you can also amend a previous commit
with the sign-off by running `git commit --amend -s`. If you've pushed
your changes to Github already you'll need to force push your branch
after this with `git push -f`. -- Thanks Chef!

## Changelog

The Sensu [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) is based on the Sensu Community
[Changelog guidelines](https://github.com/sensu-plugins/community/blob/master/HOW_WE_CHANGELOG.md).

All new changes go underneath the _Unreleased_ heading at the top of the Changelog.
Beyond that, here are some additional guidelines that should make it more clear where your
change goes in the Changelog.

### Added

Any _new_ functionality goes here. This may be a new field on a data type or a new data
type altogether; a new API endpoint; or possibly a whole new feature. In general, these
are sentences that start with the word "added."

Examples:

- `begin` field to silences that initiates silencing at a given timestamp
- /healthz endpoint that reports health of the sensu-agent process

### Changed

Changes to any existing component or functionality of the system that does not cause
breaking changes to users or developers go here. _Changed_ is distinguishable from
_Fixed_ in that it is an intentional change to existing functionality.

Examples:

- `sensu-agent` exits gracefully instead of crashing upon disconnect
- Refactored the API to use reusable controller logic

### Fixed

Fixed bugs go here.

Examples:

- `sensu-agent` no longer ignores keepalive configuration
- Don't delete auth tokens at startup

### Deprecated

Deprecated should include any soon-to-be removed functionality. An entry here that
is user facing will likely yield entries in _Removed_ or _Breaking_ eventually.

Examples:

- The /health API endpoint is being replaced by /healthz on the backend
- The /stash API endpoint is being removed in a future release

### Removed

Removed is for the removal of functionality that does not directly impact users,
these entries most likely only impact developers of Sensu.  If user facing
functionality is removed, an entry should be added to the _Breaking Changes_
section instead.

Examples:

- Removed references to `encoding/json` in favor of `json-iter`.
- Removed unused `Store` interface for `BlobStore`.

### Security

Any fixes to address security exploits should be added to this section. If
available, include an associated CVE entry.

Examples:

- Upgraded build to use Go 1.9.1 to address [CVE-2017-15041](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-15041/)
- Fixed issue where users could view entities without permission

### Breaking Changes

Whenever you have to make a change that will cause users to be unable to
upgrade versions of Sensu without intervention by an operator, your change
goes here. Try to avoid these. If they're required, we should have documented
justification in a GitHub issue and preferably a proposal. We should also bump
minor versions at this time.

Examples:

- Refactored how Checks are stored in Etcd, `sensu-backend migrate` is required to upgrade

## Development

Sensu is written in Go, and targets the 1.10.x branch of the compiler and
toolchain. When working on Sensu, you should use this version of Go.

[Go installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install)

### Protobuf

#### Overview

We are using the version **proto3** of the protocol buffers language. Here are some useful resources:

[To learn more about protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview)

[The proto3 language guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3)

#### Installation

Install the protobuf compiler since we don't use the one that golang uses.
```
brew install protobuf
```
Otherwise, see the **for non-C++ users** [instructions here.](https://github.com/google/protobuf#protocol-compiler-installation)

#### Quick Start

Once you make a change to any `*.proto` file within the **types** package, you will need to regenerate the associated `*.pb.go` file. To do so, simply run `go generate` on the package.

### Dependencies

Sensu uses [golang/dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) for managing its
dependencies. You will need to install the latest stable version of dep in
order to modify Sensu's dependencies.

[Dep releases](https://github.com/golang/dep/releases)

#### Usage

Running the following will pull all required dependencies, including static
analysis and linter tools.

```shell
./build.sh deps
```

Later, if you would like to add a dependency, run:

```shell
dep ensure -add https://my-repo.com/my/dep
```

If you would like to update a dependency, run:

```shell
dep ensure -update https://my-repo.com/my/dep
```

When you would like to remove a dependency, remove the it from `Gopkg.toml` and
then run:

```shell
dep prune
```

## Building

### Docker

The simplest way to the build Sensu is with the `sensu-go-build` image. The
image contains all the required tools to build the agent, backend and sensuctl.

```sh
docker pull sensu/sensu-go-build
docker run -it -e GOOS=darwin -v `pwd`:/go/src/github.com/sensu/sensu-go --entrypoint='/go/src/github.com/sensu/sensu-go/build.sh' sensu/sensu-go-build
```

If you would like to build for different platforms and architectures use GOOS
and GOARCH env variables. See [Optional environment variables](https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment) for more.

When complete your binaries will be present in the `target` directory.

### Manually

First ensure that you have the required tools installed to build the programs.

* Ensure that you have the Go tools installed and your environment configured.
  If not follow the official
  [Install the Go tools](https://golang.org/doc/install#install) guide.
* When building the Sensu backend you will need NodeJS and Yarn installed so
  that the web UI may be included in the binary. Follow
  [Installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and
  [Yarn Installation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) for installation
  instructions for your platform.

Once all the tools are installed you are now ready to use the build script. To
build the Sensu backend, agent and sensuctl, run:

```sh
./build.sh build
```

Each product can built separately, with one of the following:

```sh
./build.sh build_agent
./build.sh build_backend
./build.sh build_cli
```

## Testing

Run test suites:

```shell
./build.sh
```
