	// DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
	// field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
	// directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
	// from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
	// finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
	// Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
	// future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
	// For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
	// by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
	// the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
	// remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
	// exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
	// resource is fully terminated.
	// If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.
