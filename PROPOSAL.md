The following are our "engineering principles", basic guidelines to follow while working on Sensu.

This list is in no particular order and will continue to evolve.

* Keep It Simple (there is no "Stupid Simple").

* If you identify a problem, document (GitHub issue) or fix it immediately. This applies to bugs and poor design choices alike.

* Can the code be explained to a peer with ease? Can the explanation be written concisely and conveyed orally?

* Can the code be well tested in an automated fashion?

* Ask for peer support sooner than later, collaboration, not only review.

* Stick to the plan, but make yourself heard when it needs to change.
