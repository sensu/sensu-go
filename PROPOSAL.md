The following are our "engineering principles", basic guidelines to follow while working on Sensu.

This list is in no particular order and will continue to evolve.

* Strive for simplicity. Can the code be explained to a peer with ease? Can the explanation be written concisely and conveyed orally?

* If you identify a problem, document (GitHub issue) or fix it immediately. This applies to bugs and poor design choices alike.

* Can the code be well tested in an automated fashion?

* Ask for peer support sooner than later, collaboration, not only review.

* Stay the course, but let the captain know there's an iceberg.
